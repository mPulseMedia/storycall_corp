        <p><b>1. Acceptance</b></p>
        <p>
          These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of StoryCall’s website, app, and services (collectively, the “Service”).
          By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Not for emergencies.</b> StoryCall is not designed for emergency, time-sensitive, or critical communications. If you have an
          emergency, call local emergency services immediately.
        </p>
  
        <p><b>2. What StoryCall Does</b></p>
        <p>
          StoryCall converts voice messages or recordings you send by text/SMS (and other messaging platforms you choose to connect) into
          phone calls to a landline (or other phone number you provide), then returns a recorded reply back to the same message thread.
          The Service may include optional transcription and other features. Delivery may be delayed or unsuccessful due to carrier
          filtering, network conditions, or third-party platform limitations.
        </p>
  
        <p><b>3. Safety and Consent</b></p>
  
        <p><b>3.1 Permission to contact</b></p>

          <li>
            You represent and warrant that you have permission to contact any Recipient you add or message through StoryCall, including
            any required consent for automated or prerecorded calls and messages where required by law.
          </li>
          <li>You will not use the Service for harassment, spam, deception, or unlawful purposes.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p><b>3.2 Recipient opt-out</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>

            or circumvent opt-out.

          To the maximum extent permitted by law, StoryCall will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
          or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly. In all cases, StoryCall’s
          total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid to StoryCall for the Service in the 12 months prior to the event
          giving rise to the claim (or, if you paid nothing, US $100), except where liability cannot be excluded under applicable law.
        </p>
