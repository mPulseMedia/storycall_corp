        <p><b>1. Overview</b></p>
        <p>
          StoryCall (“StoryCall,” “we,” “us”) provides a service that converts voice messages or recordings you send by
          text/SMS (and other messaging platforms you choose to connect) into phone calls to a landline or other phone
          number you provide, then returns a recorded reply back to the same message thread. This Privacy Policy explains
          what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using StoryCall, Users represent that they have obtained any required consent from Recipients to receive
          automated calls and to have voice replies recorded. Recipients are informed at the start of calls that the call
          may be recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to be conservative with data: collect the minimum necessary, avoid selling or sharing for advertising,
          and give you control. We do not use your Content to train advertising models or sell datasets. If anything here
          is unclear, email <b>help@storycall.org</b>.
        </p>
